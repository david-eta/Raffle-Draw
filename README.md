# Raffle-Draw

## Description

Used PyQt5 to create a GUI that randomly selected a name from a text file as the winner of a raffle draw.

### Background

A friend of mine owned a business and wanted to promote it while rewarding one of his lucky customers. He did so by 
organising this raffle draw with a reward of a ticket to see the Marvel Movie, Endgame.

### The List of Names
The names were the customers who had bought his products within a certain time. The names were repeated the
number of times they bought a product. Hence, increasing the likelihood of a customer winning based on
how much they patronised him.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [Python 3.X](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
* Works on Windows 10, Windows 11, Mac OS and Ubuntu.

### Installing

* PyQt5 is not one of python's external libraries so it must be installed using pip.

### Executing program

Run the program on any IDE of your choice.
